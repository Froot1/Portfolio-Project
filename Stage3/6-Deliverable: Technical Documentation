## User Stories and Mockups

### User Types

- Regular User: Can sign up, log in, add friends, join groups, add/view expenses, settle debts, and view profile.
- Group Creator: Can create groups, invite members, manage group activities.

### Prioritized User Stories

#### Authentication
- **[Must Have]** As a user, I want to sign up with my email and password, so that I can create an account and use the app.
- **[Must Have]** As a user, I want to log in securely, so that I can access my account and data.

#### Friend Management
- **[Must Have]** As a user, I want to add friends, so that I can easily split expenses with people I know.
- **[Should Have]** As a user, I want to view my friends list, so that I can see who I can share expenses with.

#### Group Management

## System Architecture

### Main Components

- **Front-end:** React (TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS)
  - Handles UI, user interactions, and communicates with Supabase via REST APIs/SDK.
- **Back-end & Database:** Supabase
  - Provides authentication, database (PostgreSQL), storage, and serverless functions.
  - Manages users, groups, activities, transactions, and permissions.
- **External Services:**
  - Email (for notifications, password reset, etc.)
  - Deployment (Railway for hosting)
  - (Optional) Other APIs as needed

### Data Flow

- The **Front-end** (React) interacts with **Supabase** via REST API/SDK for authentication, CRUD operations, and storage.
- **Supabase** manages business logic, authentication, and data storage in its PostgreSQL database.
- **Supabase** communicates with **External Services** (e.g., sends emails, deploys to Railway) as needed.

## API Specifications

### External APIs

| API/Service         | Purpose                                      | Reason for Selection                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Supabase Auth       | User authentication (sign up, login, JWT)    | Secure, scalable, integrated with database  |
| Supabase Storage    | File uploads (profile photos, attachments)   | Easy integration, managed storage           |
| Email Provider (e.g., SendGrid) | Send email notifications (invites, password reset) | Reliable transactional email delivery       |

**Note:**  
- Supabase is chosen for its managed PostgreSQL, built-in auth, and storage, reducing backend complexity.
- Railway is used for deployment but is not an API consumed at runtime.

## SCM and QA Plans

### SCM Strategy

- **Version Control:** Git (hosted on GitHub or similar)
- **Branching Model:**
  - `main`: Stable, production-ready code
  - `develop`: Integration branch for features before release
  - `feature/*`: One branch per feature or bugfix (e.g., `feature/add-friends`)
- **Workflow:**
  - Developers create feature branches from `develop`
  - Regular commits with clear messages
  - Pull requests (PRs) required to merge into `develop` or `main`
  - Code reviews required before merging PRs
  - All PRs must pass automated tests before merge
- **Release Process:**
  - Merge `develop` into `main` for production releases
  - Tag releases with semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0)

### QA Strategy

- **Testing Types:**
  - Unit tests for backend logic (e.g., API endpoints, business logic)
  - Integration tests for end-to-end flows (e.g., user registration, group expense)
  - Manual testing for critical user flows and UI/UX
- **Testing Tools:**
  - **Jest:** Automated unit and integration tests for backend (Node.js/TypeScript)
  - **Supertest:** API endpoint testing
  - **Postman:** Manual and automated API testing
  - **React Testing Library:** Unit tests for React components
- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - Automated test suite runs on every PR and push to `develop`/`main`
  - Linting and code style checks (e.g., ESLint, Prettier)
- **Deployment Pipeline:**
  - **Staging:** Auto-deploy from `develop` branch to Railway staging environment for QA
  - **Production:** Auto-deploy from `main` branch to Railway production environment after passing all tests
  - Rollback and monitoring enabled for production deployments

---

## Technical Justifications

- **Supabase:** Chosen for its managed PostgreSQL database, built-in authentication, and storage, which reduces backend complexity and accelerates development.
- **Railway:** Selected for its simple, scalable, and developer-friendly deployment pipeline, supporting both staging and production environments.
- **React (with Vite and Tailwind CSS):** Enables rapid development of a modern, responsive UI with strong community support and efficient build tooling.
- **Testing Tools (Jest, Supertest, Postman, React Testing Library):** Provide comprehensive coverage for backend and frontend, ensuring code quality and reliability.
- **SCM/QA Practices:** Modern Git workflow with code reviews, CI, and automated testing ensures maintainability, collaboration, and high-quality releases.
