# System Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the application, detailing the main components, their interactions, and the technologies used.

## Main Components

- **Front-end:** React (TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS)
  - Handles UI, user interactions, and communicates with Supbase  via REST APIs/SDK.
- **Back-end & Database:** Supbase 
  - Provides authentication, database (NoSQL collections), storage, and serverless functions.
  - Manages users, groups, activities, transactions, and permissions.
- **External Services:**
  - Email (for notifications, password reset, etc.)
  - Deployment (Railway for hosting front-end)
  - (Optional) Other APIs as needed

```

### Data Flow

- The **Front-end** (React) interacts with **Supbase** via REST API/SDK for authentication, CRUD operations, and storage.
- **Supbase** manages business logic, authentication, and data storage in its NoSQL database.
- **Supbase* communicates with **External Services** (e.g., sends emails, deploys to Railway) as needed.
